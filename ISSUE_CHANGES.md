## ðŸ¤– AI-Generated Implementation for Issue #301

### Claude Analysis:
Step 1: Define the scope of the issue.
- Identify the specific actions that need to be taken in order to implement the cleanup process. This could include removing unnecessary files, deleting unused databases, or clearing out unused spaces.

Step 2: Review and fix issues.
- Implement changes based on the identified issues and ensure that they are resolved before the test environment is tested.

Step 3: Test the cleanup plan.
- Conduct a thorough testing of the implementation of the cleanup plan. This includes tests for removing redundant files, deleting unused databases, and clearing out unused spaces.

Step 4: Test the overall effect of the cleanup plan.
- After completing the above steps, test the overall effect of the cleanup plan by comparing the results with the original entity counts before and after the cleanup process was applied. This can be done using automated tests or by running unit tests for each cleanup step.

Step 5: Document the findings.
- Write up any observations, conclusions, and recommendations that may have been made during this testing phase. Include any necessary changes to the codebase as a result of the cleanup plan's implementation.

Step 6: Monitor the issue's progress.
- Continuously monitor the status of the cleanup process and make adjustments as necessary based on the feedback received from users or stakeholders.

Step 7: Implement further changes.
- Based on the testing results and any new observations, continue to implement further changes to ensure that the cleanup process is effective and sustainable. This could include adding more automated tests or improving existing unit tests for more thorough coverage.

Step 8: Post-test review and feedback.
- Gather user feedback from users who are affected by the cleanup process to gather insights on what worked well and what may need improvement before implementing any further changes or improvements.
