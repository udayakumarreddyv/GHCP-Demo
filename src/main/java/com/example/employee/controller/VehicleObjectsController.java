This code creates a Spring MVC Controller for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting vehicle objects using Java Spring Boot. The `VehicleController` class includes methods for each CRUD operation such as creating new vehicles, retrieving existing vehicles based on ID, updating existing vehicles, and deleting existing vehicles. 

The `VehicleMakeDTO` and `VehicleModelDTO` classes represent the attributes that are required to create a vehicle object, and the `VehicleYearDTO` represents attributes that are required to update or retrieve specific information about a vehicle. The methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting vehicles use Spring's Bean Interceptor APIs to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Please remember that this code only shows how you can create an example controller using Java Spring Boot, the rest API doesn't have any real-world scenarios so it would be more complex. The methods provided above are for creating a simple example to show how CRUD operations are handled in Spring MVC and Spring Boot applications.

In practice, this implementation could require additional security measures like CSRF protection or token-based authentication. However, it's important to understand how Spring Boot REST APIs work because they are designed specifically for building microservices using Java and Spring Boot development.
