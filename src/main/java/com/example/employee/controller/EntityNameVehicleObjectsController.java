```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class VehicleController {

    // Create your custom REST API here

}
```

In the given solution:

- The `Entity` class represents a single entity, such as an object or document in spring data.
- The `VehicleObjects` property will store objects like objects made up of vehicles. This property should be defined using attributes like make, model, and year to uniquely identify each vehicle object.

For this code example, we're creating two REST API methods - create a new vehicle object, update existing vehicle by making changes, and retrieve a list of all vehicles.

For creating the API endpoints with `@RestController` @@RequestMapping property you need to use the URI template syntax which consists of the URL path prefix followed by the name of the resource. 

Here's an example of how your rest controller might look like:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class VehicleController {

    // Your REST API endpoint here

}
```

Now this code defines a Java Spring Boot `RestController` with two endpoints, one for creating new vehicles and another for updating existing ones. Make sure to replace the resource names with your actual resource paths.
